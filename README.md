## Our Journey

<summary>Day 1</summary>
On the 1st day we were given a brief about the project and a figma wireframe with the webapp design. Our task was to create our own  Ai company and use the provided design to create our webapp. So the first day included figuring out how were going to approach the task, where we came to the conclusion that we would split the project into sections and create trello tickets for each task, as shown bellow.
